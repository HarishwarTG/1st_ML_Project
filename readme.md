# Medical Insurance Price Prediction Project

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the costs of medical insurance based on various personal attributes such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking habits, and region. This model aims to assist insurance companies in making informed decisions about insurance policy pricing by identifying the key factors that influence medical insurance costs.


## Overview

1.The contains the details (age, sex, bmi, children, smoking habits and region)of 11237 customers.

2.My project task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the price of insurance on its characteristics.

3.For solving this problem, I will approach the task, with a step by step approach to create a data analysis and prediction model based on (machine learning/AI algorithms, regression algorith for example) available from different Python packages, modules and classes



## ðŸ›  Tech used
1.Python 2.Sckit-Learn 3.Numpy 4.Pandas 5.Matplotlib 6.Flask 7.HTML/CSS

## Workflow

**1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This step involves analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of the features and identify any correlations or patterns that may be relevant to the prediction task.

**2.Data Processing and Feature Transformation:** The data is processed and transformed to prepare it for modeling. This includes handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical variables, and normalizing the data.

**3.Model Building:** A predictive model is built using various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, ridge regression, and random forest regressor. Each model is evaluated using performance metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared.

**4.Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter** tuning is performed for each model to optimize its performance.

**5.Model Evaluation and Deployment:** The best-performing model is selected and deployed using Flask for real-world applications.
